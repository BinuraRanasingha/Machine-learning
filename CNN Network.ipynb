    "A **convolutional neural network (CNN)** is a type of **artificial neural network** designed for tasks such as image recognition and processing. It's particularly effective in analyzing visual data, thanks to its ability to automatically and adaptively learn spatial hierarchies of features from the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "CNNs use a specialized architecture that includes **convolutional layers**, **pooling layers**, and **fully connected layers.** Convolutional layers apply convolution operations to the input data, capturing local patterns and features. Pooling layers then reduce the spatial dimensions of the representation, focusing on the most important information. Fully connected layers connect every neuron in one layer to every neuron in the next layer, enabling high-level reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "CNNs have been highly successful in tasks like image classification, object detection, and facial recognition, among others. Their architecture is inspired by the visual processing in the human brain, making them well-suited for tasks involving spatial hierarchies of features."
